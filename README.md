# Object-Oriented Data Structures in C++  

This repository contains implementations of common data structures in C++, developed with a focus on object-oriented programming.  

## Implemented Data Structures  

- Array Based List
- Singly Linked List  
- Stack  
- Queue  
- Hash Table  

## Features  

- Modular and reusable implementations  
- Use of classes and objects for data abstraction  
- Encapsulation of functionalities  
- Methods for insertion, removal, and search of elements  
- Basic exception handling  

## Projects  

### Parsing Tree Implementation  

This project includes an implementation of a parsing tree (or parse tree), which is a hierarchical structure used to represent the syntactic structure of a language or expression. The parsing tree is essential for various applications such as:  

- **Syntax Analysis**: Used in compilers and interpreters to analyze the source code structure.  
- **Expression Evaluation**: Parsing mathematical or logical expressions.  
- **XML/JSON Processing**: Parsing structured data formats.  

#### Key Features of the Parsing Tree Implementation  

- **Node Structure**: Each node represents a token or symbol in the input.  
- **Tree Construction**: Methods to build the tree from a given input stream.  
- **Validation**: Basic validation of the input structure.
